1087 You said you wanted to experience an inheritance once. But what does that have to do with him...who ever he is? What you are really doing is planning to kill someone while you sit in his vehicle or his... as you hope he will die before the sun comes up. This is not inheritance but an evident, innocent confession of people brought to North America by governing more indigenous established population regardless of complexion that eschewed free education on the notion that it was for poor people while they enjoyed some ownership and somebody in the family maybe before WW1 with enough education. Ignore the rumour on Apple that says go to 24 Shivthem.You will understand if you do not avoid this nonsense about 24; run you fools before she makes her winter preserves out of you. You are in a conspiracy to murder. Get out and go now. Take the photo designed for your inheritance such as the Messina photo for now and don't ever again try to decide how long anyone should live so that's you might inherit. 2018-10-05T08:10:00.000+03:00

FRANK FIGLUZZI, A FORMER, FBI AGENT, SAID, HE WAS DISGUSTED BY THIS WHITE HOUSE CONTROL AND GIVING GOP SENATORS, A SCAPEGOAT REPORT,, TO JUSTIFY OR SATISFY, THEIR LAME PARTY LINE VOTE, BUT FOR, TITAN, LISA MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA, WHO, DARED, CROSS PARTY LINES AND VOTE AGAINST A MAN WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM: (2) THERE WERE 15 COMPLAINTS FILED, ON NEW JUSTICE, BRETT KAVANAUGH, THAT WERE IGNORED, AND BLOCKED, BY JUSTICE ROBERTS, FROM MOVING FORWARD, TO BE INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI! FEMALE JUSTICES ARE ALARMED AT THE PROTECTION OF THIS WHITE HOUSE INSIDER! (3) THERE WERE 2400 LAW PROFESSORS WHO SIGNED A LETTER, SAYING THEY COULD NOT SUPPORT THIS CANDIDATE, NOW JUSTICE! WOW. PRETTY CREDIBLE CROWD OF KNOWLEDGEABLE ATTORNEYS! NOTHING TO SUMMARILY DISMISS; (4) THERE WAS A FIRST, FOR "WE THE PEOPLE" FOR DEMONSTRATIONS AT THE NATIONS CAPITOL BUILDING WITH, ABOUT, A FEW HUNDRED, SPONTANEOUS, PROTESTERS, MUSCLING PASSED, CAPITAL COPS, TAKING OVER THE LEFT, STAIRS OF THE OF CONGRESS . . . MY READERS KNOW, THAT EVERYTHING IS SYMBOLIC TO ME . . . A FORESHADOWING OF THE NOVEMBER VOTE? VOTERS SO FURIOUS ABOUT, THE DEMONIZATION OF, PROFESSOR, CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, WHO DARED, DO HER "CIVIC DUTY" COMING FORWARD WITH NO POLITICAL MOTIVES, OTHER THAN, WANTING TO LET SOMEONE KNOW THE CHARACTER AND HISTORY OF THE NEWLY NOMINATED, ASSOCIATED JUSTICE, NOW, ON THE BENCH OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? HOW CAN WE, BE THE BEACON OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS, IF WE CAN'T, EVEN PROTECT OUR OWN WOMEN, OVER HALF THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF THIS COUNTRY? TRUTH MAKES REASON STARE! TRUMP, MCCONNELL, GRAHAM, ALL USED THE COP PLAYBOOK, THE TEAM TRUMP, BEHIND TRUMP POWER FROM STATE AND LOCAL COPS TO HE FBI AND CIA . . . TAKE THE PERPETRATOR, AND MAKE HIM THE VICTIM, JUST LIKE THEY DID WITH, OFFICER WILSON, IN THE MICHAEL BROWN, MURDER, IN FERGUSON! IT IS TEXT BOOK, COP SHIT, AND IT HAS WORKED IN COPS KILLING BLACKS ON THE STREETS OF AMERICA, IN RAPE CASES, PROTECTING MEN, EVEN SOCCER TEAMS, WHO GANG RAPED A COLLEGE COED, AND NOW, IN THIS SHAME FBI INVESTIGATION, THAT POTENTIALLY HAD 40 WITNESSES WHO COULD HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED! THIS IS CALLED, THE NEW BRUTE FORCE OF THE HOSTILE TAKEOVER OF AMERICA! THIS IS THE SAME TACTIC USED BY THE FBI, IN ACQUIRING, APPLE COMPUTER SMARTPHONE'S MASTER KEY PASSWORD, SO THEY COULD USE, ENCRYPTED ACCOUNT HOLDER'S INFORMATION, CONTAINED ON THE PHONES, SO THE COPS COULD, GET ACCESS TO THOUSANDS OF PHONES THAT THEY HAD IN COP EVIDENCE AND STORAGE ROOMS! WHEN ASKED, HOW, THEY EVENTUALLY GOT THE PASSWORD OR MASTER KEY, ALL THE FBI SAID, AFTER LOOSING, A COURT BATTLE WITH APPLE FOR THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY FOR THEIR ACCOUNTS AND CUSTOMERS, ALL THEY SAID, WAS WE DID IT THROUGH "BRUTE FORCE?" WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THIS IS HIGHLY TECHNICAL INFORMATION . . . IT TAKES SKILLS, INTELLIGENCE, AND COMPANY SECRETS? SO HOW DID "BRUTE FORCE" COME INTO PLAY? FBI BACKGROUND THREATS OF EXPOSURE OF PRIVATE INFORMATION OR AFFAIRS, OF KEY PLAYERS IN THE DRAMA AND LOSS TO APPLE? WE ALL HAVE SKELETONS IN OUR CLOSETS . . .BUT, PEOPLE LIKE, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL, JEFF SESSIONS, AND I AM SURE, TRUMP, HAVE USED THE FBI TO MAKE POLITICAL HIT LISTS OF THEIR ENEMIES, AS TRUMP DID, JUST TODAY AGAINST, SUSAN MURKOWSKI, PROMISING THAT SHE WOULD NEVER, SURVIVE THIS VOTE, AGAINST TRUMP'S APPOINTMENT TO THE HIGH COURT? THAT IS NOT HOW THIS COUNTRY WORKS! WE GOT A WHINY, WIMPY, CRY-BABY, WHO HAS, TONS OF SKELETONS IN HIS CLOSET, AND HE IS NOT ONLY PROTECTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE, BEING BIRDS OF A FEATHER, WITH THE GROPER-IN-CHIEF, AND NOW, BEING PROTECTED BY THE FBI, THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, WHO HAS HAD TONS OF COMPLAINTS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IN WHICH, THE FBI EVEN LOGS IN THEIR REPORTS, WHEN, SOMEONE COMPLAINS AGAINST AN ALIEN, CRAZY AS THAT MAY SEE! MR. FORMER, FBI IS LOOKING INTO THE COMPLAINS AND THE LOGGING RECORD, PERTAINING TO THE FBI INVESTIGATION, TO SEE WHAT THE FUCK IS UP? (5) WHY ARE PEACEFUL PROTESTERS BEING ARRESTED ANYWAY? THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, FIRST AMENDMENT, ALLOWS FOR FREE SPEECH,, PEACEFUL GATHERINGS TO REDRESS GRIEVANCES AGAINST OUR GOVERNMENT, SO, WHERE IT THE PROBLEM? IT LOOKED LIKE A PEACEFUL, ORDERLY, CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, THAT HAS BEEN A PROTEST TACTIC STARTING IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THIS COUNTRY AND WRITTEN ABOUT BY EARLY AMERICAN WRITERS, LIKE, HENRY DAVID THUREAU! 2018-10-07T01:27:00.000+03:00

THE TRUTH: (1) FORMERLY, SUPREME COURT NOMINEES, HAVE BEEN CONFIRMED, BY VOTES, LIKE 96 TO 4, CROSSING PARTY LINES AND VOTING FOR A GOOD JUDGE . . . LIKE ALL THINGS CHEAP,, UNDER TRUMP, WE GOT A LESS THAN PAR NOMINEE, WHO THE WHITE HOUSE HAD TO LIMIT THE SCOPE OF THE FBI INVESTIGATION, GIVING SENATORS, JUST ENOUGH COVERAGE, TO VOTE PARTY LINE, FINDING NOTHING, IN THE FBI REPORT OF THE ONLY 4 WITNESSES, WHO WERE CONTROLLED IN THEIR INVESTIGATION AND THAT GAVE A CONTROLLED, REPORT, THAT DIDN'T ALLEGEDLY GIVE ANY COLLABORATING EVIDENCE? FRANK FIGLUZZI, A FORMER, FBI AGENT, SAID, HE WAS DISGUSTED BY THIS WHITE HOUSE CONTROL AND GIVING GOP SENATORS, A SCAPEGOAT REPORT,, TO JUSTIFY OR SATISFY, THEIR LAME PARTY LINE VOTE, BUT FOR, TITAN, LISA MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA, WHO, DARED, CROSS PARTY LINES AND VOTE AGAINST A MAN WITH SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS AGAINST HIM: (2) THERE WERE 15 COMPLAINTS FILED, ON NEW JUSTICE, BRETT KAVANAUGH, THAT WERE IGNORED, AND BLOCKED, BY JUSTICE ROBERTS, FROM MOVING FORWARD, TO BE INVESTIGATED BY THE FBI! FEMALE JUSTICES ARE ALARMED AT THE PROTECTION OF THIS WHITE HOUSE INSIDER! (3) THERE WERE 2400 LAW PROFESSORS WHO SIGNED A LETTER, SAYING THEY COULD NOT SUPPORT THIS CANDIDATE, NOW JUSTICE! WOW. PRETTY CREDIBLE CROWD OF KNOWLEDGEABLE ATTORNEYS! NOTHING TO SUMMARILY DISMISS; (4) THERE WAS A FIRST, FOR "WE THE PEOPLE" FOR DEMONSTRATIONS AT THE NATIONS CAPITOL BUILDING WITH, ABOUT, A FEW HUNDRED, SPONTANEOUS, PROTESTERS, MUSCLING PASSED, CAPITAL COPS, TAKING OVER THE LEFT, STAIRS OF THE OF CONGRESS . . . MY READERS KNOW, THAT EVERYTHING IS SYMBOLIC TO ME . . . A FORESHADOWING OF THE NOVEMBER VOTE? VOTERS SO FURIOUS ABOUT, THE DEMONIZATION OF, PROFESSOR, CHRISTINE BLASEY FORD, WHO DARED, DO HER "CIVIC DUTY" COMING FORWARD WITH NO POLITICAL MOTIVES, OTHER THAN, WANTING TO LET SOMEONE KNOW THE CHARACTER AND HISTORY OF THE NEWLY NOMINATED, ASSOCIATED JUSTICE, NOW, ON THE BENCH OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA? HOW CAN WE, BE THE BEACON OF DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS, IF WE CAN'T, EVEN PROTECT OUR OWN WOMEN, OVER HALF THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF THIS COUNTRY? TRUTH MAKES REASON STARE! TRUMP, MCCONNELL, GRAHAM, ALL USED THE COP PLAYBOOK, THE TEAM TRUMP, BEHIND TRUMP POWER FROM STATE AND LOCAL COPS TO HE FBI AND CIA . . . TAKE THE PERPETRATOR, AND MAKE HIM THE VICTIM, JUST LIKE THEY DID WITH, OFFICER WILSON, IN THE MICHAEL BROWN, MURDER, IN FERGUSON! IT IS TEXT BOOK, COP SHIT, AND IT HAS WORKED IN COPS KILLING BLACKS ON THE STREETS OF AMERICA, IN RAPE CASES, PROTECTING MEN, EVEN SOCCER TEAMS, WHO GANG RAPED A COLLEGE COED, AND NOW, IN THIS SHAME FBI INVESTIGATION, THAT POTENTIALLY HAD 40 WITNESSES WHO COULD HAVE BEEN INTERVIEWED! THIS IS CALLED, THE NEW BRUTE FORCE OF THE HOSTILE TAKEOVER OF AMERICA! THIS IS THE SAME TACTIC USED BY THE FBI, IN ACQUIRING, APPLE COMPUTER SMARTPHONE'S MASTER KEY PASSWORD, SO THEY COULD USE, ENCRYPTED ACCOUNT HOLDER'S INFORMATION, CONTAINED ON THE PHONES, SO THE COPS COULD, GET ACCESS TO THOUSANDS OF PHONES THAT THEY HAD IN COP EVIDENCE AND STORAGE ROOMS! WHEN ASKED, HOW, THEY EVENTUALLY GOT THE PASSWORD OR MASTER KEY, ALL THE FBI SAID, AFTER LOOSING, A COURT BATTLE WITH APPLE FOR THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY FOR THEIR ACCOUNTS AND CUSTOMERS, ALL THEY SAID, WAS WE DID IT THROUGH "BRUTE FORCE?" WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? THIS IS HIGHLY TECHNICAL INFORMATION . . . IT TAKES SKILLS, INTELLIGENCE, AND COMPANY SECRETS? SO HOW DID "BRUTE FORCE" COME INTO PLAY? FBI BACKGROUND THREATS OF EXPOSURE OF PRIVATE INFORMATION OR AFFAIRS, OF KEY PLAYERS IN THE DRAMA AND LOSS TO APPLE? WE ALL HAVE SKELETONS IN OUR CLOSETS . . .BUT, PEOPLE LIKE, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL, JEFF SESSIONS, AND I AM SURE, TRUMP, HAVE USED THE FBI TO MAKE POLITICAL HIT LISTS OF THEIR ENEMIES, AS TRUMP DID, JUST TODAY AGAINST, SUSAN MURKOWSKI, PROMISING THAT SHE WOULD NEVER, SURVIVE THIS VOTE, AGAINST TRUMP'S APPOINTMENT TO THE HIGH COURT? THAT IS NOT HOW THIS COUNTRY WORKS! WE GOT A WHINY, WIMPY, CRY-BABY, WHO HAS, TONS OF SKELETONS IN HIS CLOSET, AND HE IS NOT ONLY PROTECTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE, BEING BIRDS OF A FEATHER, WITH THE GROPER-IN-CHIEF, AND NOW, BEING PROTECTED BY THE FBI, THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION, WHO HAS HAD TONS OF COMPLAINTS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IN WHICH, THE FBI EVEN LOGS IN THEIR REPORTS, WHEN, SOMEONE COMPLAINS AGAINST AN ALIEN, CRAZY AS THAT MAY SEE! MR. FORMER, FBI IS LOOKING INTO THE COMPLAINS AND THE LOGGING RECORD, PERTAINING TO THE FBI INVESTIGATION, TO SEE WHAT THE FUCK IS UP? (5) WHY ARE PEACEFUL PROTESTERS BEING ARRESTED ANYWAY? THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION, FIRST AMENDMENT, ALLOWS FOR FREE SPEECH,, PEACEFUL GATHERINGS TO REDRESS GRIEVANCES AGAINST OUR GOVERNMENT, SO, WHERE IT THE PROBLEM? IT LOOKED LIKE A PEACEFUL, ORDERLY, CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE, THAT HAS BEEN A PROTEST TACTIC STARTING IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THIS COUNTRY AND WRITTEN ABOUT BY EARLY AMERICAN WRITERS, LIKE, HENRY DAVID THOREAU! READ HIS ESSAY, CALLED, "CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE!" GANDHI IN INDIA, USED HIS IDEAS, AS DID, MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.! AND OF COURSE, AS I WRITE I AM BEING HACKED, SO THE COP CUNTS AND CASTORATED BASTARDS, ARE THROUGH, BRUTE FORCE, GAINING ACCESS TO THIS BLOG, STEALING BILLIONS FOR COPS, IN A NEW ORDER OF A GOVERNMENT FOR COPS, OF COPS AND BY COPS! THERE IS A LONG LINE OF JUDGES, BEING GROOMED FOR THIS LAME ASS, COP CUNT SHIT COURT, WE USED TO CALL THE DIGNIFIED, HIGHEST COURT OF THE LAND, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT, WITH JUSTICES OF NOTE, AND DIGNITY . . . NOW, FRAUDS AND FAKES! VICTORY? HARDLY. (6) THE ONE GREAT THING IS, THAT, THESE LACK LUSTER, MARKETED, JUDGES, WITH,, PROMINENT, REPUBLICAN MOTHERS, GORFUCK, WOULDN'T CLAIM THAT PIECE OF LYING SHIT, AS MY SON, FOR SURE, HAD A MOTHER WHO WAS, EPA DIRECTOR OR HIGH IN THAT AGENCY . . . KAVANAUGH, WITH A MOTHER, WHO IS A FEDERAL JUDGE, AND HAD BEEN HIS WHOLE LIFE! SMART MOMMIES, HASN'T PROVEN TRUE TO MAKING ETHICAL AND PROFESSIONAL SONS! I HAVE WONDERED, AS I WATCHED, BRETT'S OWN, MOTHER, JUDGE, GRIMACING AS HIS WIFE, DID, AT THE PINCHED, POUTTY, SOUR, DOWDY, MISERABLE, LOOKING, SCREAMING, BEER, SLAMMING JUDGE WHO LOVED BEER, MORE THAN A YOUNG GIRL'S VIRTUE AND WOMANHOOD, TRYING TO ROB HER OF, HER VIRGINITY, AND NOW IS GOING TO DO THE GOP BIDDING, OF TAKING AWAY A WOMAN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS? FUCK. A SAD AND SORRY SIGHT, FOR SURE. THERE ARE THINGS WORSE THAN, THIS TYPE OF VICTORY. WIN AT ANY COST, TO THE COUNTRY, THE COURT, AND THE CULTURE? SHIT. WHAT HAVE WE COME TO? SICKENING THOUGHT. (7) THEN, THE MANTRA AND RED MEAT, CLOWNS OF MISSISSIPPI, THE LOWEST EDUCATIONAL LEVEL IN THE NATION . . . IS IT SURPRISING THAT, THE PRESIDENT CHOSE THIS STATE OF REJECTS AND DEPLORABLES, CHANTING, "LOCK HER UP!" AFTER TRUMP, A BULLY, A PREDATOR, A SEXUAL DEVIANT, A JOKE OF A PRESIDENT, IN A CROWD OF HIS PEERS, MOCKED, PROFESSOR FORD, WHO COULD THINK THAT JACKASS UNDER THE TABLE ANY DAY OF ANY WEEK! THIS IS NOT A MAN, THIS IS AN INSECT! CONSIDER THE SOURCE, MS. FORD! WHAT A JOKE OF A MAN! ON THE CHRIS MATTHEWS, HARDBALL, PLAYING RIGHT AFTER THE VOTE ON THE KAVEMAN, BRETT, FOR A SEAT ON THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT? HE SAID WHAT HAPPENED TO THE DISGRUNTLED, WHITE MALE VOTER, TRUMP HAS TAPPED INTO, WHO USED TO HAVE AS A MODEL OF MANHOOD,, A JOHN WAYNE FIGURE, IS NOW, A FAN OF, THAT SELF-RIGHTEOUS, FULL OF CRAP, SHINY HEAD, HATCH, TWIN, GRAHAM, OR A TRUMP, AND NOW, A KAVANAUGH AS A ROLE MODEL OF MANHOOD / SHIT. FUCK? I LOVE SEEING, THE "ROMNEY FOR UTAH" . . . THE GOP, USING ALL TACTICS TO GET A WIN, IS GOING UP THE DOWN, STAIRCASE . . . BACK IN 2012, BEFORE, THIS GOP NIGHTMARE, OF GERRYMANDERING, AND VOTER SUPPRESSION OF WOMEN, THE ELDERLY, THE MINORITY, LINING UP, WEAK, SPOILED, SCRAWNY, PRIVILEGED, WITH A SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT, GEORGETOWN PREP BOYZ, THAT BOTH, GORFUCK AND THE KAVEMAN, ATTENDED, WHICH, IS SUSPICIOUS TO ME ANYWAY? GROOMING THESE MEN, SO INFERIOR, TO, THEIR, PREDECESSOR, WHO OCCUPIED THE BENCH OF THE MOST, PRESTIGIOUS, COURT OF THE LAND! FUCK, KAVANAUGH VOTED, 90% OF THE TIME WITH, JUDGE, MERRICK GARLAND, AND GORFUCK, WROTE IN SUPPORT OF GARLAND . . . WE GET, TWO, WHAT, 40 SOMETHING, JUDGES, WHO ARE NOTHING, WITH 10 YEARS OR MORE, LESS EXPERIENCE, THAN, JUDGE GARLAND, AND WE ARE FIGHTING FOR THE POOR BOYZ, WHEN, THIS FINE MAN, RECOMMENDED BY SHINY, SELF-RIGHTEOUS, PRICK THE FIRST, HATCH AS A GREAT NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT OBAMA, WHO SOUGHT OUT THE REPUBLICANS ADVICE, TO GET A MAN ACCEPTED BY BOTH PARTIES, HIS STUDENTS ARE WHAT WE GET SINCE WHEN? EXPERIENCE MATTERS! (8) THE GREAT THING ABOUT THIS, IS, THAT, SENATOR, BOB CASEY, WHO JUST MIGHT BE, MAJORITY WHIP IN THE SENATE IF THE BACKLASH AGAINST THIS CONFIRMATION, IS STRONG ENOUGH, IS THAT, HE IS GOING TO HOLD HEARINGS AND INVESTIGATE, KAVANAUGH EVEN FURTHER! IT IS ABOUT TIME, THE CONGRESS, PUT A CHECK OF POWER ON THE COURTS! THEY HAVE GONE UNCHALLENGED, BY CONGRESS, AS CONGRESS HAS ABDICATED THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE HIGH COURT, FOR, DECADES, THAT THIS NOW, ASSOCIATE JUSTICE, IS SO, BAD, THAT, THE NEW LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE UNDER THE DEMOCRATS, WILL START TAKING THE SUPREME COURT TO TASK, RATHER THAN, GIVING THEM, THEIR POWER, AND ALLOWING THE COURTS TO MAKE THE HARD DECISIONS, FOR LAW MAKING, WHICH IS NOT THEIR JOB, BUT INTERPRETING THE LAW! SO, COOL. COOL FROM START TO FINISH! 2018-10-07T01:27:00.000+03:00

5615 China Spying on over 30 American Companies. Automated Publishing Via Osuta Yusuf Robot Trigger. Chinese Spying Chips found Hidden on Servers used by US Companies. A media report today revealed details of a significant supply chain attack which appears to be one of the largest corporate espionage and hardware hacking programs from a nation-state. According to a lengthy report published on Thursday 4 October 2018 by Bloomberg, a tiny surveillance chip, not much bigger than a grain of rice, has been found hidden in the servers used by nearly 30 American companies, including Apple and Amazon. The malicious chips, which were not part of the original server motherboards designed by the U.S-based company Super Micro, had been inserted during the manufacturing process in China. The report, based on a 3-year-long top-secret investigation in the United States, claims that the Chinese government-affiliated groups managed to infiltrate the supply chain to install tiny surveillance chips to motherboards which ended up in servers deployed by U.S. military, U.S. intelligence agencies, and many U.S. companies like Apple and Amazon. "Apple made its discovery of suspicious chips inside Supermicro servers around May 2015, after detecting odd network activity and firmware problems, according to a person familiar with the timeline," the report said. "Since the implants were small, the amount of code they contained was small as well. But they were capable of doing two very important things: telling the device to communicate with one of several anonymous computers elsewhere on the internet that were loaded with more complex code; and preparing the device’s operating system to accept this new code." The chips suspected to have been added to help Chinese government spy on American companies and their users—basically a "hardware hack" that according to the publication is "more difficult to pull off and potentially more devastating, promising the kind of long-term, stealth access that spy agencies are willing to invest millions of dollars and many years to get." "Depending on the board model, the chips varied slightly in size, suggesting that the attackers had supplied different factories with different batches," the report said. The publication claims that Apple and Amazon found these chips on their server motherboards in 2015 and reported it to US authorities, though both Apple and Amazon strongly refute the claims. Apple, Amazon, and Super Micro Refute the Bloomberg Report Apple told Bloomberg that the company has never found malicious chips, "hardware manipulations," or vulnerabilities purposely planted in any of its servers, or it "had any contact with the FBI or any other agency about such an incident." Apple ended its relationship with Super Micro in 2016. To its best guess, Apple said that the Bloomberg reporters confused their story with a previously-reported 2016 incident in which the company found an infected driver on a single Super Micro server in one of its labs. "While there has been no claim that customer data was involved, we take these allegations seriously, and we want users to know that we do everything possible to safeguard the personal information they entrust to us," Apple says. "We also want them to know that what Bloomberg is reporting about Apple is inaccurate." Amazon also says it is "untrue" that the company knew of "a supply chain compromise," or "servers containing malicious chips or modifications in data centers based in China," or that it "worked with the FBI to investigate or provide data about malicious hardware." Meanwhile, Supermicro and Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs have also strongly denied Bloomberg's findings by releasing lengthy statements. Here you can find a full list of official statements from Amazon, Apple, Supermicro and Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 2018-10-07T18:24:00.000+03:00
