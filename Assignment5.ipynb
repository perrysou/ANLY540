      "\n",
      "Nintendo is planning an update to the Switch, according to new reports.The new console is likely to arrive next year, the Wall Street Journal said. But beyond that details remain murky.The Switch was first released in March of last year. The new update is being planned for the second half 2019 and could come as soon as the summer, according to the WSJ.It isn't clear what updates the new version of the console would bring. But chief among them is likely to be a new screen: the first Switch, while broadly praised, drew some criticism for the quality of the display.Nintendo is said to be avoiding the OLED technology that is used in Apple's new iPhones and which can give improved performance and rich blacks. But it could improve to the more detailed LCD screens on other recent handsets.That uncertainly might partly be because Nintendo itself isn't exactly clear what the new console might look like.If it does arrive, it's likely that it will follow the lead of recent new consoles like the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X – adding new features and improving specs, while staying on the same generation and allowing players to bring games and friends over. Nintendo has already done that in the past, repeatedly updating the Nintendo 3DS after it was first released. \n",

      "Google’s Emergency Location Service Improves 911 Response\n",
      "Google is making a small but pivotal change as it relates to calls placed to 911 operators. Having recently finalized a complex partnership with RapidSOS and West (two emergency technology companies) and T-Mobile, Google will now send location data from its \"Emergency Location Service\" when an Android user places a 911 call.\n",
      "If the caller is a T-Mobile customer, the information will be passed along via the carrier. Where 911 call centers use RapidSOS, Google will send the location data via the technology company. In the US Virgin Islands, Google has made the same arrangement with the Emergency Tech company, West.\n",
      "While the announcement may raise some surprised eyebrows, the change has been in the works for more than a year. Google has spent much of that time testing. Their findings were that the location data Google sent over was more accurate and arrived more quickly than the data the 911 call centers had been getting previously.\n",
      "Not to be outdone, Apple announced in June of this year that it was developing a similar service for iOS users, and that beginning with iOS 12, Apple devices would automatically send location data to emergency call centers when users dial 911.\n",
      "Even privacy advocates agree that this is generally a good move, and it's one of the growing number of instances where smart use of technology can save lives. Anything we can do to give our nation's emergency call centers an edge is an important change. Currently, those call centers take an average of 140,000 calls a day, so this is by no means a trivial issue.\n",
      "Kudos to both Google and Apple for taking bold action on this issue. While we may not like the idea of having our location data shared, in this particular instance, it certainly seems like a smart play.  \n",

      "SAN JOSE, Calif. , Oct. 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) , a global leader in enterprise computing, storage, networking solutions and green computing technology, strongly refutes reports that servers it sold to customers contained malicious microchips in the motherboards of those systems.\n",
      "In an article today, it is alleged that Supermicro motherboards sold to certain customers contained malicious chips on its motherboards in 2015. Supermicro has never found any malicious chips, nor been informed by any customer that such chips have been found.\n",
      "Each company mentioned in the article (Supermicro, Apple, Amazon and Elemental) has issued strong statements denying the claims:\n",
      "Apple stated on CNBC, \"We are deeply disappointed that in their dealings with us, Bloomberg's reporters have not been open to the possibility that they or their sources might be wrong or misinformed. Our best guess is that they are confusing their story with a previously reported 2016 incident in which we discovered an infected driver on a single Supermicro server in one of our labs. That one-time event was determined to be accidental and not a targeted attack against Apple.\"\n",
      "Steve Schmidt , Chief Information Security Officer at Amazon Web Services stated, \"As we shared with Bloomberg BusinessWeek multiple times over the last couple months, at no time, past or present, have we ever found any issues relating to modified hardware or malicious chips in Supermicro motherboards in any Elemental or Amazon systems.\"\n",
      "Supermicro has never been contacted by any government agencies either domestic or foreign regarding the alleged claims.\n",
      "Supermicro takes all security claims very seriously and makes continuous investments in the security capabilities of their products. The manufacture of motherboards in China is not unique to Supermicro and is a standard industry practice. Nearly all systems providers use the same contract manufacturers.
