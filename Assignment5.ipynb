The Monterey Bay Aquarium in a tweet on Wednesday noted Apple\\'s squid emoji is \" upside down .\" More specifically, the siphon \\u2014 used for breathing, excreting waste and locomotion via jet propulsion \\u2014 on Apple\\'s squid is claimed to be located on its \"face\" when it should be positioned on the opposite side of the head. Pun-happy personnel responsible for maintaining the aquarium\\'s Twitter page took umbrage with the squid emoji, suggesting Apple took undue artistic license when it designed the character. \"Not even squidding the siphon should be behind the head [right now] it just looks like a weirdo nose,\" the tweet reads. Indeed, Apple\\'s take is the only emoji to place the siphon, also known as the funnel, on the squid\\'s \"face,\" as revealed in a collection of squid characters aggregated by Emojipedia. The organ is not present on designs in use by Samsung, Microsoft, Facebook and others. Despite the fervor, Apple\\'s version appears to be a faithful rendition of certain squid species. Biological drawings and photographs of dissections readily available online corroborate Apple\\'s siphon placement. Anterior and ventral views of the bilaterally symmetrical animal show the funnel jutting out from beneath the creature\\'s mantle between its eyes, with fin, arm and tentacle locations mirroring those of Apple\\'s emoji. The squid emoji was approved as part of Unicode 9.0 in 2016, and Apple\\'s iteration has not changed since its debut that same year. Topics:', '\\n')\n",

      "(u'Qualcomm Snapdragon 855: 6 reasons why it will transform Android phones By Sahil Mohan Gupta Dec. 6, 2018, 5:46 a.m. It is the fastest ARM-based mobile system on chip (SoC) in the world\\nWhile Qualcomm announced the Snapdragon 855 mobile platform yesterday at the opening keynote of its annual tech summit, it left out a bunch of details, besides vaguely stating that it is the fastest ARM-based mobile system on chip (SoC) in the world.\\nBut today, on Day 2 of the Snapdragon Summit, Qualcomm has come out with a detailed agenda of what makes this new SoC tick, giving details about its custom Kryo cores, unique AI engine architecture and also its 5G capabilities. Make no mistake, this chipset is a big deal for Qualcomm which is facing threats from Apple\\u2019s court case, regulatory issues and also generally it is being perceived to have lost the mantle of the king of mobile chipsets supplanted by Apple\\u2019s A-line of custom silicon that powers the iPhone.\\nQualcomm has to do better because Android OEMs depend on it, otherwise, there could be others who could take the route that Huawei and Samsung have adopted. This marks an existential crisis for the silicon giant. This is why Qualcomm had Samsung\\u2019s mobile SVP Justin Denison at the event yesterday saying that it would be the first one to deploy a 5G smartphone. Today, they had OnePlus CEO Pete Lau on stage saying that the 2019 OnePlus phone would be the first one to use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855.\\nTo achieve this leap in performance, Qualcomm has focussed on some key aspects which include connectivity, core CPU performance, the gaming experience, on-device AI and the imaging experience.\\nX50 and X24 modems for breakthrough connectivity\\nThe theme for the Snapdragon 855 has been centred around 5G and for that Qualcomm has deployed the X50 5G modem. But that\\u2019s an optional module which will be made on-device by the OnePlus and Samsung in the UK and the US. For OEMs that don\\u2019t want to go all in on 5G, there is the X24 modem which provides 2 gigabyte LTE. These two modems also become the first in the industry to provide Wi-Fi 6 which uses 8x8 sounding, while utilising less power and being more secure at the same time.\\nIt is also the world\\u2019s first 60Hz Wi-Fi system. In terms of connectivity, the Snapdragon 855 is formidable and there is no SoC in the market which competes with it. This means in 2019, if you\\u2019re a stickler for connectivity, Android phones will be the fastest ones. This is nothing new, it is just that Qualcomm has extended its advantage here.\\nBiggest leap in CPU performance on a Snapdragon\\nQualcomm has evolved the big. Little architecture which has been a facet of ARM-based SoCs for a while.\\nLike Huawei\\u2019s Kirin 980 and the Samsung\\u2019s Exynos 9820, it has moved towards a concept of a prime core which is based on the latest ARM Cortex A76 chips with Qualcomm\\u2019s customisations resulting in Kryo 485 cores. The prime core is clocked at 2.84GHz coupled with three more performance cores based on the same architecture clocked at 2.42GHz.\\nThere are four efficiency cores which max out at 1.84GHz. More so, the entire SoC is manufactured on a 7nm process by TSMC which further improves performance. This results in a 45% boost in performance over the Snapdragon 845 which is the biggest leap in a single generation that Qualcomm has achieved. That being said, this would just about match what Apple has achieved with a more efficient 6 core architecture on the A12 Bionic on the iPhone XS.\\nEvolved gaming experience with faster GPU and Snapdragon Elite gaming\\nThe new Adreno 640 GPU provides a 20% boost over the Adreno 630 in the Snapdragon 845. This alone was quite a big jump, but Qualcomm has doubled down on sustained performance and software-based optimisations which will make gaming on Snapdragon 855 based devices comparable to the iPhone, if not better.\\nThis starts with it being the first processor to support the Vulkan 1.1 API and support for physics-based rendering on games for more realistic graphics. Snapdragon Elite Gaming is also an added boon which makes sure the battery life is better optimised for gaming and that the phones don\\u2019t heat as much during long gaming sessions.\\nMoreover, the entire visual experience on the Snapdragon 855 has been improved with support for 120fps viewing natively supported along with HDR 10 plus support and native support for H.265 and VP9 hardware accelerated codecs. Additionally, the audio experience has been improved with Aptx adaptive and Qualcomm\\u2019s true wireless stereo plus.\\nAI at the heart of the Snapdragon 855\\nOne of the biggest critiques of the previous generation Snapdragon processors was that they had not doubled down or embraced AI the way Apple or Huawei had with their processors. That changes this year.\\nQualcomm always had a software-based DSP in the Hexagon, but this year it has achieved something more powerful and unique with its fourth generation Hexagon 690 DSP. Qualcomm is mimicking the human brain and is using different parts of the SoC which includes the GPU, CPU and the DSP in a dynamic way to provide heterogeneous AI processing. This, of course, comes with mission-specific upgrades to the GPU, CPU, DSP and also includes a dedicated Tensor Flow accelerator which is to speed up on-device machine learning for Google\\u2019s Tensor Flow.\\nThe end result is impressive as Qualcomm claims that the Snapdragon 855 can perform seven trillion operations per second for machine learning which is actually better than the five trillion operations per second on the A12 Bionic at the heart of the iPhone.\\nThis is also 2x better AI performance than Huawei\\u2019s Kirin 980 chip and 3x better than the Snapdragon 845. Qualcomm has also collaborated with Google and optimised the Snapdragon 855 for Google apps including Google lens.\\nA master of computational photography\\nQualcomm has doubled down on the core computational photography capabilities which come natively with the Snapdragon 855. The Spectra 380 becomes the worlds first computer vision hardware ISP. The computer vision pipeline also uses the AI engine, engaging all aspects of the Snapdragon 855.\\nSome of the cool things this facilitates is native Google Pixel 2-like night-mode photography, better depth sensing, speed boost with 4x better performance, support for HDR video with portrait blurs and three cameras providing three fields of view in one image file by utilising the HEIF format with meta-data support adding information for HDR colour, computer vision, depth map details. Even for things like 4K video and HDR video, this chip now consumes 30% less power than the Snapdragon 845.\\nThe most accurate in-display fingerprint scanner\\nOne of the peripheral things that Qualcomm announced was the new 3D sonic sensor which is a new type of in-display fingerprint scanner technology. This is said to be better than the current crop of in-display scanners that you see on phones like the Vivo Nex, OnePlus 6T and the Huawei Mate 20 Pro. Instead of shining a light from beneath the screen, it uses ultrasonic frequencies to authenticate which means it retains accuracy when the finger is wet or dirty. It should also be faster.', '\\n')\n",
