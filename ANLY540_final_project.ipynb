      "The stock market's severe drop could be an ominous sign \n",
      "\n",
      "So is this it — the end of the decade-long bull market? Or is it the sort of normal, healthy pullback that often follows a strong showing?\n",
      "Last week, it felt like the bottom dropped out of the stock market.\n",
      "The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.5 percent for the week, ending with a 559-point rout Friday that left the index in negative territory for the year.\n",
      "The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has fallen into a \"correction,\" meaning it's off more than 10 percent from its peak reached Sept. 20.\n",
      "And once-highflying tech stocks faltered with Apple, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet all ending last week showing stock-price losses for the year — driving the Nasdaq composite index into a correction too.\n",
      "So is this it — the end of the decade-long bull market? Or is it the sort of normal, healthy pullback that often follows a strong showing?\n",
      "\"Everyone is trying to figure that out,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, though he's among those arguing that stocks are going through a typical retreat after lengthy gains, as they often have.\n",
      "Obscuring any clarity for both professional money managers and millions of Americans with 401(k)s and other retirement accounts are conflicting trends that are keeping downward pressure on stock prices and sparking volatile trading.\n",
      "They include the U.S.-China tariffs and trade battle, falling oil prices, the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, President Donald Trump's mercurial bursts on Twitter, declining growth in corporate profits — and, ultimately, fears that the nine-year economic expansion is ready for a cyclical contraction.\n",
      "This fall's pullback is nowhere near as severe — at least not yet — as some of the major busts of the past two decades. The S&P 500 fell nearly 57 percent during the 2008-09 financial crisis and nearly 49 percent in the dot-com crash of 2000-02. Those were bear markets, or drops of 20 percent or more from their previous highs.\n",
      "Second, the triple-digit swings in the Dow industrial average — while unnerving a decade ago — are now more common because the market has climbed so high since then, and the declines are less severe on a percentage basis. In contrast, when the Dow fell 508 points on Oct. 19, 1987, it was a 22.6 percent loss — the largest single-day percentage drop on record.\n",
      "In addition, the stock market reached its highest levels in history only a few months ago, and that was after the market soared in 2017, when the S&P 500 gained nearly 20 percent and the Nasdaq composite rose 28 percent. As a result, it's not surprising that investors would be willing to sell and capture those profits when signs of trouble surface.\n",
      "Last year also was unusual for the dearth of volatility that is now again common.\n",
      "\"We had an incredible amount of investor optimism coming out of the election in 2016,\" said Peter Heilbron, senior investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management. \"Last year was the anomaly, not this year. A year like this is much more normal for the market than we had in 2017.\"\n",
      "That's not to discount the pain investors have felt in recent months or how dangerous the trade and economic threats are to the market. The S&P 500 lost 6.9 percent in October, its biggest monthly decline in seven years.\n",
      "And last week the yield on 5-year Treasury bonds fell below the yield for 2-year bonds for the first time since 2007 — a so-called inverted yield curve that is typically seen as a gauge of recession risk. (Investors typically are rewarded with higher yields for locking up their money longer, not the other way around.)\n",
      "Yet stocks also are on pace to end the year with minor changes. Even after last week's dreary showing, the Dow and S&P 500 were down only 1.3 percent and 1.5 percent for the year, respectively, and the Nasdaq was up 1 percent.\n",
      "Investors also pay attention to how stock prices compare with the underlying corporate earnings for those stocks. If prices get too far ahead of the earnings growth, the stocks might be too \"rich\" or pricey and vulnerable to a sell-off. Conversely, if prices match or lag behind earnings growth, it might be a buy.\n",
      "Early this year, the S&P 500 was trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18.7 times the expected average earnings of the S&P component companies for the next 12 months, according to FactSet.\n",
      "Now, with the market having tumbled, that forward price-to-earnings multiple has fallen to 15.44, which is about average.\n",
      "The consensus seems to be that corporate earnings are slowing — albeit from a blistering pace. Stovall said that at the start of this year Wall Street expected earnings growth of 11.5 percent for 2018.\n",
      "\"It looks like we're going to see twice that amount, with average earnings (growth) for the S&P (companies) of 23 percent,\" — profits, he said, that were partly fueled by the drop in federal corporate tax rates from the Republican tax cuts. But next year he projects that growth will slow to 7.5 percent. \n",

I thought Apple had a great reputation and decided to use one to help me live stream, play video games, etc. After I purchased the Apple, however, I realized a Windows PC was better suited for my live-streaming needs. I ended up purchasing a Windows PC that was more compatible with the streaming software etc... Sadly, I have not used the Apple and I cant justify keeping something I don't use. I'd rather it go to someone who put it to use. Plus, I want to purchase a Peloton Bike and the proceeds of this will help me justify this new expense LOL.. Even if I am taking a loss on the Apple :( As you are probably aware, the Apple's capabilities are tremendous. The original price after taxes was $5,442. I was given a $300 business owner discount and paid $5,142.06 (out the door) after tax. I purchased it from an Apple Store in person. I do have the original receipt if you would like to see it.

      "YOU see it so often. The kids are playing on the beach and mum or dad has his face buried in his phone.\n",
      "Or teenage girls seem more intent on capturing a moment for their Instagram feed than enjoying the moment themselves.\n",
      "But our smart devices are not just invading our leisure time.\n",
      "Studies are showing that even the mere presence of your phone can be such a huge distraction that affects your productivity at work.\n",
      "So how do we regain control, set a better example for our kids, and importantly put some boundaries in around the use of our devices.\n",
      "Ironically, tech giants like Apple and Microsoft are now urging parents to take up the downtime tools they have put in place to limit the use of their devices. Family sharing can help control what apps your children are allowed to purchase.\n",
      "The federal Department of Health recommends that children under two should not spend any time watching TV or using electronic media.\n",
      "Those aged two to five should be limited to less than one hour a day.\n",
      "Those aged five to 17 should spend no more than two hours, including watching TV or looking at a computer, phone or tablet.\n",
      "So how can you regain control?\n",
      "Apple suggests one of the best ways is to set up Family Sharing on all devices - and set limits for children using their iPad or iPhone.\n",
      "HOW TO SET UP FAMILY SHARING\n",
      "Once you have done that, set up Family Sharing. One of the big advantages is that once you buy an app, movie, TV show or music, it can be shared among the whole family, rather than purchased again and again.\n",
      "A good example might be a great educational app for the iPad which may be used by the next sibling when they are old enough. SCREEN TIME: How much time are you spending on your phone?\n",
      "Apple's latest operating system, iOS 12, also allows you to monitor how much you - and the kids - spend on their devices.\n",
      "HOW TO SET UP SCREEN TIME\n",
      "The beauty of Screen Time is, as a parent, you can see how much time they use certain apps, for example, Facebook and Instagram versus more productive or creative applications of their time.\n",
      "Opening Screen Time can be depressing. Last week, I spent more than four hours on social media, nearly two hours on email and another two hours on websites - and I was on a week off!\n",
      "I picked up my phone more than 80 times in the day after receiving more than 70 notifications a day. Talk about distracted!\n",
      "One simple solution, of course, is to limit the number of applications that can send you notifications. WHAT content should your kids be able to view or buy?\n",
      "Another is to set time limits you and your kids can spend on specific apps and websites.\n",
      "You might even trade 'active' time - time playing outside - for some screen time.\n",
      "HOW TO TURN ON ASK TO BUY\n",
      "You can also use family sharing to manage in-app purchases so that every time your child tries to buy a new app - or something within the game itself - you are notified and you have to approve it.\n",
      "Before approving, you can check out the app's description and age recommendations within the App store straight from the notice you are sent.\n",
      "Another good idea is to set content and privacy restrictions. For example, younger children may not be able to visit any websites, while older children may have a range of educational ones you think are beneficial to them. \n",

      "\n",
      "Silicon Valley used to be technology companies. But it has become the “morality police,” controlling free speech on its platforms.\n",
      "What could go wrong?\n",
      "In a speech Monday, Apple CEO Tim Cook said:\n",
      "“ Hate tries to make its headquarters in the digital world . At Apple, we believe that technology needs to have a clear point of view on this challenge. There is no time to get tied up in knots. That’s why we only have one message for those who seek to push hate, division and violence: You have no place on our platforms.”\n",
      "Here’s the goliath problem :\n",
      "Who gets to define what words and phrases protected under the First Amendment constitute hate — a catchall word that is often ascribed to any offensive speech someone simply doesn’t like?\n",
      "Will Christians who don’t support abortion rights or having their tax dollars go toward Planned Parenthood be considered purveyors of hate for denying women the right to choose? Will millions of Americans who support legal immigration, as opposed to illegal immigration, be labeled xenophobes or racists and be banned from the digital world?\n",
      "Yes and yes. How do we know? It’s already happening, as scores of conservatives nationwide are being shadow banned and/or censored on social media, YouTube, Google and beyond.\n",
      "Their crime?\n",
      "Running afoul of leftist Silicon Valley executives who demand conformity of thought and simply won’t tolerate any viewpoint that strays from their rigid political orthodoxy.\n",
      "For context, consider that in oppressive Islamist regimes throughout the Middle East, the “morality police” take it upon themselves to judge women’s appearance, and if a woman doesn’t conform with their mandatory and highly restrictive dress code — e.g., wearing an identity-cloaking burqa — she could be publicly shamed, arrested or even stoned in the town square.\n",
      "In modern-day America, powerful technology companies are actively taking the role of the de facto morality police — not when it comes to dress but when it comes to speech — affecting millions. Yes, to date, those affected are not getting stoned, but they are being blocked in the digital town square, where billions around the globe do their business, cultivate their livelihoods, connect with others and get news.\n",
      "That is a powerful cudgel to levy against individuals and groups of people. Wouldn’t you say?\n",
      "Right now, unelected tech billionaires living in a bubble in Palo Alto — when they’re not flying private to cushy climate summits in Davos — are deciding who gets to enjoy the freedom of speech enshrined in the U.S. Constitution and who does not based on whether they agree with people’s political views and opinions or not.\n",
      "You see how dangerous this can get — real fast — as partisan liberal elites running Twitter, Facebook, Google (including YouTube), Apple and the like are now dictating to Americans what they can and cannot say online.\n",
      "In communist regimes, these types of folks are known as central planners.\n",
      "The election of Donald Trump was supposed to safeguard our freedoms, especially regarding speech — a foundational pillar of a democracy. It’s disappointing that hasn’t happened, as the censorship of conservative thought online has gotten so extreme and out of control many are simply logging off for good.\n",
      "A failure to address this mammoth issue could cost Trump in 2020. If his supporters are blocked online — where most voters get their news — he’ll be a one-term president.\n",
      "It’s time for Congress to act before the morality police use political correctness as a Trojan horse to decide our next election. Post navigation \n",

      "\n",
      "Tech News Facebook slips from 1st to 7th in 2019 'Best Places to Work' list Among tech companies, Facebook is ahead of Google, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon but behind LinkedIn, Procore Technologies, and Zoom Video Communications Published 12:24 3:40 PM, December 11, 2018 FACEBOOK. Photo by Jonathan Nackstrand/AFP MANILA, Philippines – Facebook’s seemingly endless string of controversies in 2018 has had many serious effects on how its users perceive it, and how governments and civil society groups approach the platform. Now, the company appears to be feeling some of the effects internally: the company slipped down several notches in Glassdoor’s annual list of “Best Places to Work,” going from the top spot in 2018 to 7th in the newest rankings. Glassdoor, a US-based website that allows employees to review the companies they work for, ranks companies based on several factors including management behavior, salaries and benefits, and work-life balance. This year, Facebook scored a 4.5 out of 5, down from last year’s 4.6. The score is still relatively high, however, as Facebook remains one of the top tech companies to work for in Glassdoor’s list, with only LinkedIn, Procore Technologies, and Zoom Video Communications topping Facebook in the tech vertical. Right next to Facebook is Google at 8, Adobe at 30, Microsoft at 34, Apple at 71, and Amazon outside the top 100. Google also slipped from the 5th spot last year. Yet the slip partly reflects the troubles that Facebook has faced and continues to face this year. In an interview, Glassdoor community expert Scott Dobroski suggested to US outlet CNBC that the company’s long-standing “move fast” mantra may have also caused employee satisfaction to drop from a 4.6 rating in Q1 2018 to a 4.3 in Q4: “Facebook employees talked about the ‘move fast’ culture sometimes moving too fast.” Reviews on Glassdoor tend to be still fairly positive but some reviews do point out that all the attention recently in the press is a con and that management could be more transparent with employees more. Work-life balance is among the biggest concerns in the reviews, with employees linking that to the ultra-competitive atmosphere in the company, pushing everyone to put in extra hours. Several former Facebook employees talked to CNBC as well, saying that some employees have been trying to look elsewhere because of falling stock prices, the scandals, and the increasing bureaucracy. – Rappler.com \n",

      "Own an iPhone 6 or later and having battery issues? Here’s a reminder that you just have a few weeks to score a replacement battery from Apple for $29. After December 31, the price for a battery replacement will more than double to $79.\n",
      "Apple’s $29 battery replacement program for out-of-warranty iPhone SE, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X devices, ends December 31, 2018.\n",
      "Last year, Apple acknowledged that it had been quietly “throttling” or reducing the function of iPhone 6, 6s, 7, and SE models when the battery is old, cold, or low on power. To “address customer concerns,” Apple reduced the price of out-of-warranty iPhone 6 and later battery replacements by $50 — from $79 to $29.\n",
      "So if you own an iPhone 6 or later model with battery issues, make sure to head to an Apple Store near you before December 31. Note, however, that the deal also only applies once per iPhone, so if you had your battery replaced already, you can’t avail of a second replacement.\n",
      "If you’re not experiencing severe battery issues with your iPhone, it could still be good to get your battery replaced before the program ends so you can avoid potential problems after December 31.\n",

      "Dup#689: PR Practitioners Should be Innovative, Professional – TPT Boss Public Relations professionals in the country have been urged to be awakening to innovative ideas that could resolve issues relating to the profession and their clients in order to attain the needed growth required as well as respectable position among their counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was guest speaker at the December 2018 edition of the Lagos PR Clinic of the state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) under the theme: Ideapreneurship: The Nature of Our Trade. He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

      "Dup#689: PR Practitioners Should be Innovative, Professional – TPT Boss Public Relations professionals in the country have been urged to be awakening to innovative ideas that could resolve issues relating to the profession and their clients in order to attain the needed growth required as well as respectable position among their counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was guest speaker at the December 2018 edition of the Lagos PR Clinic of the state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) under the theme: Ideapreneurship: The Nature of Our Trade. He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

      "Dup#689: PR Practitioners Should be Innovative, Professional – TPT Boss Public Relations professionals in the country have been urged to be awakening to innovative ideas that could resolve issues relating to the profession and their clients in order to attain the needed growth required as well as respectable position among their counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was guest speaker at the December 2018 edition of the Lagos PR Clinic of the state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) under the theme: Ideapreneurship: The Nature of Our Trade. He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

      "Dup#689: PR Practitioners Should be Innovative, Professional – TPT Boss Public Relations professionals in the country have been urged to be awakening to innovative ideas that could resolve issues relating to the profession and their clients in order to attain the needed growth required as well as respectable position among their counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was guest speaker at the December 2018 edition of the Lagos PR Clinic of the state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) under the theme: Ideapreneurship: The Nature of Our Trade. He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

      "Dup#689: PR Practitioners Should be Innovative, Professional – TPT Boss Public Relations professionals in the country have been urged to be awakening to innovative ideas that could resolve issues relating to the profession and their clients in order to attain the needed growth required as well as respectable position among their counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was guest speaker at the December 2018 edition of the Lagos PR Clinic of the state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) under the theme: Ideapreneurship: The Nature of Our Trade. He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

      "Dup#689: PR Practitioners Should be Innovative, Professional – TPT Boss Public Relations professionals in the country have been urged to be awakening to innovative ideas that could resolve issues relating to the profession and their clients in order to attain the needed growth required as well as respectable position among their counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was guest speaker at the December 2018 edition of the Lagos PR Clinic of the state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) under the theme: Ideapreneurship: The Nature of Our Trade. He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

      "Dup#689: PR Practitioners Should be Innovative, Professional – TPT Boss Public Relations professionals in the country have been urged to be awakening to innovative ideas that could resolve issues relating to the profession and their clients in order to attain the needed growth required as well as respectable position among their counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was guest speaker at the December 2018 edition of the Lagos PR Clinic of the state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) under the theme: Ideapreneurship: The Nature of Our Trade. He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

      "Dup#689: PR Practitioners Should be Innovative, Professional – TPT Boss Public Relations professionals in the country have been urged to be awakening to innovative ideas that could resolve issues relating to the profession and their clients in order to attain the needed growth required as well as respectable position among their counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was guest speaker at the December 2018 edition of the Lagos PR Clinic of the state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) under the theme: Ideapreneurship: The Nature of Our Trade. He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

      "Dup#689: PR Practitioners Should be Innovative, Professional – TPT Boss Public Relations professionals in the country have been urged to be awakening to innovative ideas that could resolve issues relating to the profession and their clients in order to attain the needed growth required as well as respectable position among their counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was guest speaker at the December 2018 edition of the Lagos PR Clinic of the state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) under the theme: Ideapreneurship: The Nature of Our Trade. He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

      "Dup#689: PR Practitioners Should be Innovative, Professional – TPT Boss Public Relations professionals in the country have been urged to be awakening to innovative ideas that could resolve issues relating to the profession and their clients in order to attain the needed growth required as well as respectable position among their counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was guest speaker at the December 2018 edition of the Lagos PR Clinic of the state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) under the theme: Ideapreneurship: The Nature of Our Trade. He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

      "Dup#689: PR Practitioners Should be Innovative, Professional – TPT Boss Public Relations professionals in the country have been urged to be awakening to innovative ideas that could resolve issues relating to the profession and their clients in order to attain the needed growth required as well as respectable position among their counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was guest speaker at the December 2018 edition of the Lagos PR Clinic of the state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) under the theme: Ideapreneurship: The Nature of Our Trade. He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

      "Dup#689: PR Practitioners Should be Innovative, Professional – TPT Boss Public Relations professionals in the country have been urged to be awakening to innovative ideas that could resolve issues relating to the profession and their clients in order to attain the needed growth required as well as respectable position among their counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was guest speaker at the December 2018 edition of the Lagos PR Clinic of the state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) under the theme: Ideapreneurship: The Nature of Our Trade. He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

      "Dup#689: PR Practitioners Should be Innovative, Professional – TPT Boss Public Relations professionals in the country have been urged to be awakening to innovative ideas that could resolve issues relating to the profession and their clients in order to attain the needed growth required as well as respectable position among their counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was guest speaker at the December 2018 edition of the Lagos PR Clinic of the state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) under the theme: Ideapreneurship: The Nature of Our Trade. He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

      "Dup#689: PR Practitioners Should be Innovative, Professional – TPT Boss Public Relations professionals in the country have been urged to be awakening to innovative ideas that could resolve issues relating to the profession and their clients in order to attain the needed growth required as well as respectable position among their counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was guest speaker at the December 2018 edition of the Lagos PR Clinic of the state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) under the theme: Ideapreneurship: The Nature of Our Trade. He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

      "Dup#689: PR Practitioners Should be Innovative, Professional – TPT Boss Public Relations professionals in the country have been urged to be awakening to innovative ideas that could resolve issues relating to the profession and their clients in order to attain the needed growth required as well as respectable position among their counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was guest speaker at the December 2018 edition of the Lagos PR Clinic of the state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) under the theme: Ideapreneurship: The Nature of Our Trade. He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

      "Dup#689: PR Practitioners Should be Innovative, Professional – TPT Boss Public Relations professionals in the country have been urged to be awakening to innovative ideas that could resolve issues relating to the profession and their clients in order to attain the needed growth required as well as respectable position among their counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was guest speaker at the December 2018 edition of the Lagos PR Clinic of the state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) under the theme: Ideapreneurship: The Nature of Our Trade. He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

      "Dup#689: PR Practitioners Should be Innovative, Professional – TPT Boss Public Relations professionals in the country have been urged to be awakening to innovative ideas that could resolve issues relating to the profession and their clients in order to attain the needed growth required as well as respectable position among their counterparts. This was the submission of the Chief Consultant of TPT International, Adetokunbo Modupe, who was guest speaker at the December 2018 edition of the Lagos PR Clinic of the state chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations (NIPR) under the theme: Ideapreneurship: The Nature of Our Trade. He postulated that PR practitioners are ideapreneurs who should be driven by intellectual ideas that are well tailored towards clients’ needs and their target publics for desired results, and not be inundated with business gains in the manner of entrepreneurs. Modupe, a Harvard-trained ideapreneur with over two decades experience in PR, affirmed that since the profession is dynamic, practitioners should re-examine their business modules as ideapreneurs, think and develop ideas that would invariably translate to income generation. “Don’t let the world drive you, drive the world with your ideas. This keeps us in a more respectable position before our clients who should not think that we are in the business just to make money. We should not see ourselves as entrepreneurs but there is nothing wrong in thinking about wealth” he explained. Modupe described ideapreneurs as deep thinkers who creates jobs, have a mind of their own; explore alternatives to the norms by fostering ideas and are not motivated by pedestrian or temporary success but enduring legacies. He further stated that PR is about thinking and managing thought processes for the benefit of other people’s reputation, and likened it to innovation pentathlon, a structured process that removes the risk of failure as ideas progress. According to him, great men like Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple; Elon Musk, Chief Executive Officer of Tesla Motors; and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon who have all made global impact in their various endeavours were driven by creative ideas. “It is time we sit down and say to ourselves, what do we really do? If you do not know you are an ideapreneur, you will let yourself down. So let’s change the way we do our business, as we need to conquer our fears,” Modupe challenges his fellow practitioners. He noted that the PR industry is hardly recognised, and it is partly responsible for the way clients rate practitioners. One of the reasons he identified as responsible for this is the proliferation of quacks, which is fallout of the porous entry barrier into the profession. “This has earned the profession a depressing image,” he added. The TPT boss however called on the NIPR to take bold steps in checkmating the activities of these quacks in order to attain development in the industry. Modupe is also an alumnus of Lagos Business School and that of St. John University in the United Kingdom, among other world-renowned institutions. He is the Founder of TPT International, a reputable PR organisation which footprints in all the sectors of the economy. The agency has been recognised with awards by professional and other bodies within and outside Nigeria.\n",

      "\n",
      "Or is it the sort of normal, healthy pullback that often follows a strong showing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, it felt like the bottom dropped out of the stock market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.5 percent for the week, ending with a 559-point rout Friday that left the index in negative territory for the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has fallen into a \"correction,\" meaning it's off more than 10 percent from its peak reached Sept. 20.\n",
      "\n",
      "And once-highflying tech stocks faltered with Apple, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet all ending last week showing stock-price losses for the year — driving the Nasdaq composite index into a correction too.\n",
      "\n",
      "So is this it — the end of the decade-long bull market?\n",
      "\n",
      "Or is it the sort of normal, healthy pullback that often follows a strong showing?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everyone is trying to figure that out,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, though he's among those arguing that stocks are going through a typical retreat after lengthy gains, as they often have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obscuring any clarity for both professional money managers and millions of Americans with 401(k)s and other retirement accounts are conflicting trends that are keeping downward pressure on stock prices and sparking volatile trading.\n",
      "\n",
      "They include the U.S.-China tariffs and trade battle, falling oil prices, the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, President Donald Trump's mercurial bursts on Twitter, declining growth in corporate profits — and, ultimately, fears that the nine-year economic expansion is ready for a cyclical contraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "This fall's pullback is nowhere near as severe — at least not yet — as some of the major busts of the past two decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "The S&P 500 fell nearly 57 percent during the 2008-09 financial crisis and nearly 49 percent in the dot-com crash of 2000-02.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those were bear markets, or drops of 20 percent or more from their previous highs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the triple-digit swings in the Dow industrial average — while unnerving a decade ago — are now more common because the market has climbed so high since then, and the declines are less severe on a percentage basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, when the Dow fell 508 points on Oct. 19, 1987, it was a 22.6 percent loss — the largest single-day percentage drop on record.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the stock market reached its highest levels in history only a few months ago, and that was after the market soared in 2017, when the S&P 500 gained nearly 20 percent and the Nasdaq composite rose 28 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, it's not surprising that investors would be willing to sell and capture those profits when signs of trouble surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year also was unusual for the dearth of volatility that is now again common.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We had an incredible amount of investor optimism coming out of the election in 2016,\" said Peter Heilbron, senior investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Last year was the anomaly, not this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "A year like this is much more normal for the market than we had in 2017.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That's not to discount the pain investors have felt in recent months or how dangerous the trade and economic threats are to the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The S&P 500 lost 6.9 percent in October, its biggest monthly decline in seven years.\n",
      "\n",
      "And last week the yield on 5-year Treasury bonds fell below the yield for 2-year bonds for the first time since 2007 — a so-called inverted yield curve that is typically seen as a gauge of recession risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Investors typically are rewarded with higher yields for locking up their money longer, not the other way around.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet stocks also are on pace to end the year with minor changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even after last week's dreary showing, the Dow and S&P 500 were down only 1.3 percent and 1.5 percent for the year, respectively, and the Nasdaq was up 1 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors also pay attention to how stock prices compare with the underlying corporate earnings for those stocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "If prices get too far ahead of the earnings growth, the stocks might be too \"rich\" or pricey and vulnerable to a sell-off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, if prices match or lag behind earnings growth, it might be a buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early this year, the S&P 500 was trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18.7 times the expected average earnings of the S&P component companies for the next 12 months, according to FactSet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, with the market having tumbled, that forward price-to-earnings multiple has fallen to 15.44, which is about average.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consensus seems to be that corporate earnings are slowing — albeit from a blistering pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stovall said that at the start of this year Wall Street expected earnings growth of 11.5 percent for 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It looks like we're going to see twice that amount, with average earnings (growth) for the S&P (companies) of 23 percent,\" — profits, he said, that were partly fueled by the drop in federal corporate tax rates from the Republican tax cuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "But next year he projects that growth will slow to 7.5 percent.\n",
