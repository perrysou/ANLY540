      "Mopria Alliance Launches Mopria Scan App and Universal Standard Designed for Android, Mopria Scan offers a convenient way to scan and enhance productivity SAN RAMON, Calif.-Wednesday 5 December 2018 [ AETOS Wire ] (BUSINESS WIRE) -- The Mopria® Alliance, a global non-profit membership organization providing universal standards and solutions for print and scan, today announced the release of its Mopria Scan app. Mopria Scan provides a complete scan solution and universal standard that is compatible with scan devices from most manufacturers. The new app enables scanning of photos, documents and other media directly to an Android device. Mopria Scan is available for download from Google Play or the Mopria website.The Mopria Scan app unlocks the convenience of scanning at work, at home or on the go by streamlining the scanning process allowing users to scan directly from their scanner or multi-function printer (MFP) to an Android device. Where previous scanning methods required vendor-specific applications to be installed, Mopria Scan eliminates the hassle of installing apps for multiple scanners and most scanner brands are supported.Mopria Scan arrives at a time when the workforce increasingly favors mobility and digital workflows. In a recent study conducted by the Mopria Alliance on millennial habits, 60% of respondents indicated that when it comes to digitally capturing print documents, they would prefer to use a scanner over simply taking a photograph with their cell phone. In addition, over 80% of respondents said that they used email to send documents electronically. Of those, nearly 70% used their mobile device to send those documents, and 23% upload them to cloud storage.“Mobile scanning is more important now that ever and this research shows the increasing demand for digital document scanning and sharing on mobile devices,” said Greg Kuziej, Chairman of the Board at the Mopria Alliance. “With the enhanced usability of archived documents, mobile scanning increases the efficiency of the process while also enabling new collaborative and remote use cases.”With Mopria Scan, scanning to an Android device has never been easier. Mobile scanning offers several benefits, such as the ability to save files on a mobile device, in the cloud or straight to a mobile app. Mobile scan functionality means users can send their scanned files directly to email, file browsers, document viewers, or cloud services like Dropbox, Evernote, Google Drive and more. Mopria Scan also offers a wide range of universal settings options like resolution, color, file format and custom scan areas.Additional details on Mopria Scan along with steps on how the app works can be found here.The Mopria Alliance was founded by Canon, HP, Samsung and Xerox, and the nonprofit membership organization has since grown to 21 members, representing the worldwide print and scan business.

      "\n",
      "Facebook's board of directors on Wednesday defended COO Sheryl Sandberg's request to investigate billionaire George Soros, a prominent critic of the social network. The tech giant has acknowledged that Sandberg asked her staff to look into Soros' financial motivations after he called companies like Facebook and Google a \"menace\" during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n",
      "\"As is to be expected following an attack from such a well-known and widely respected figure, Facebook staff immediately initiated research to attempt to understand the motivations driving the criticism, financial or otherwise,\" the letter says. \"To be clear, Ms. Sandberg's question was entirely appropriate given her role as COO. When a well-known and outspoken investor attacks your company publicly, it is fair and appropriate to do this level of diligence.\"\n",
      "Facebook General Council Colin Stretch sent the letter Wednesday to Patrick Gaspard, president of Soros' Open Society Foundations, on behalf of the Facebook board. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported news of the letter .\n",
      "The world's largest social network has been under fire since The New York Times reported last month that Facebook had hired Definers Public Affairs, an agency that provides opposition research to political campaigns, to investigate Soros.\n",
      "In an interview with \" CBS This Morning \" on Nov. 16, Sandberg said Definers was hired by \"the communications team\" and that she only learned about its work from the Times. \"Definers was hired, we have lots of firms. They were hired not to smear anyone. Not to get any articles written or do anything false. I learned of that in the paper yesterday as well when Mark did,\" she said.\n",
      "She later acknowledged in a Facebook post on Nov. 21 that \"some of their work was incorporated into materials presented to me and I received a small number of emails where Definers was referenced.\"\n",
      "The letter from Facebook's board responds to a letter Gaspard posted on Twitter on Tuesday, in which he said Sandberg \"did not speak in good faith\" when she told him she knew nothing about Definers' efforts.\n",
      "Facebook's board emphasized Wednesday that Sandberg didn't know about Definers' work, and that the work was \"already underway\" when she sent an email asking for research on Soros.\n",
      "Open Society Foundations didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

      " TECH 06/12/2018 9:26 AM IST | Updated 06/12/2018 9:51 AM IST Internal Facebook Documents Show It Used User Data As Competitive Weapon UK Parliamentary committee accused Facebook of cutting special deals with some app developers to give them more access to data, while icing out others. Associated Press Dado Ruvic / Reuters Representative image. Internal Facebook documents released by a UK parliamentary committee offer the clearest evidence yet that the social network has used its enormous trove of user data as a competitive weapon, often in ways designed to keep its users in the dark.\n",
      "Parliament's media committee accused Facebook on Wednesday of cutting special deals with some app developers to give them more access to data, while icing out others that it viewed as potential rivals.\n",
      "In other documents, company executives discussed how they were keeping the company's collection and exploitation of user data from its users. That included quietly collecting the call records and text messages of users of phones that run on Google's Android operating system without asking their permission.\n",
      "The UK committee released more than 200 pages of documents on the tech giant's internal discussions about the value of users' personal information. While they mostly cover the period between 2012 and 2015 — the first three years after Facebook went public — they offer a rare glimpse into the company's inner workings and the extent to which it used people's data to make money while publicly vowing to protect their privacy.\n",
      "ALSO READ: Dictionary.com Swipes At Facebook With Word Of The Year For 2018\n",
      "The company's critics said the new revelations reinforced their concerns over what users actually know about how Facebook treats their data.\n",
      "\"These kinds of schemes are exactly why companies must be required to disclose exactly how they are collecting and sharing our data, with stiff penalties for companies that lie about it,\" Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, said in a statement.\n",
      "Facebook called the documents misleading and said the information they contain is \"only part of the story.\"\n",
      "\"Like any business, we had many internal conversations about the various ways we could build a sustainable business model for our platform,\" the company said in a statement. \"But the facts are clear: We've never sold people's data.\"\n",
      "In a Facebook post, company CEO Mark Zuckerberg sought to put the documents in context. \"Of course, we don't let everyone develop on our platform,\" he wrote. \"We blocked a lot of sketchy apps. We also didn't allow developers to use our platform to replicate our functionality or grow their services virally in a way that creates little value for people on Facebook.\"\n",
      "The UK committee seized the documents from app developer Six4Three, maker of a now-defunct bikini-picture search app. Six4Three acquired the files as part of a US lawsuit that accuses Facebook of deceptive, anti-competitive business practices. The documents remain under court seal in the US.\n",
      "In a summary of key issues pertaining to the documents, the committee said Facebook \"whitelisted,\" or made exceptions for companies such as Airbnb and Netflix, that gave them continued access to users' \"friends\" even after the tech giant announced changes in 2015 to end the practice.\n",
      "\"Facebook have clearly entered into whitelisting agreements with certain companies, which meant that after the platform changes in 2014/15 they maintained full access to friends data,\" the committee said in a statement. \"It is not clear that there was any user consent for this, nor how Facebook decided which companies should be whitelisted or not.\"\n",
      "The documents \"raise important questions about how Facebook treats users' data, their policies for working with app developers, and how they exercise their dominant position in the social media market,\" said committee chair Damian Collins. \"We don't feel we have had straight answers from Facebook on these important issues, which is why we are releasing the documents.\"\n",
      "The cache includes emails from Zuckerberg and other key members of his staff. The emails show Zuckerberg and other executives scheming to leverage user data to favor companies not considered to be threats and to identify potential acquisitions.\n",
      "Collins said the emails raise important issues, particularly around the use of the data of Facebook users. \"The idea of linking access to friends' data to the financial value of the developers' relationship with Facebook is a recurring feature of the documents,\" Collins said.\n",
      "The committee's summary said Facebook collected data about the mobile apps its users favored to help it decide which companies to acquire. It also said Facebook knew that an update to its Android mobile app phone system — which allowed the Facebook app to hoover up user call logs and text messages — would be controversial.\n",
      "\"To mitigate any bad PR, Facebook planned to make it as hard as possible for users to know that this was one of the underlying features of the upgrade of their app,\" the summary said.\n",
      "In a post Wednesday, Facebook continued to stand by its stance that the feature was \"is opt in for users and we ask for people's permission before enabling.\"\n",
      "The Android data collection practice was unearthed in April as the Cambridge Analytica scandal roiled Facebook. The data mining firm, employed by the 2016 Trump campaign, exploited lax Facebook data-sharing policies to obtain data on millions of users without their consent.\n",
      "Facebook executives clearly understand the material is valuable. An unsigned memo setting policy for a system upgrade known as \"Platform 3.0\" laid out a case for shutting out any app developer who could be construed as a competitor.\n",
      "\"There are a small number of developers whom no amount of sharing to FB or monetary value can justify giving them access to Platform,\" the memo said. \"These developers do not want to participate in the ecosystem we have created, but rather build their own ecosystem at the expense of our users, other developers and, of course, us. That is something that we will not allow.\"\n",
      "The documents also suggest Facebook would jealously safeguard its interests. In a January 2013 email exchange, Zuckerberg signed off on cutting access to Twitter's Vine video-producing app, which had allowed users to find their friends on Vine by pulling in data from Facebook.\n",
      "\"Unless anyone raises objections,\" Facebook Vice President Justin Osofsky wrote, the company would cut Vine's access to users' friend networks. \"We're prepared reactive PR.\"\n",
      "\"Yup, go for it,\" Zuckerberg replied.\n",
      "The documents also suggest robust internal discussions about linking data to revenue.\n",
      "\"There's a big question on where we get the revenue from,\" Zuckerberg said in one email. \"Do we make it easy for (developers) to use our payments/ad network but not require them? Do we require them? Do we just charge a (revenue) share directly and let (developers) who use them get a credit against what they owe us? It's not at all clear to me here that we have a model that will actually make us the revenue we want at scale.\" \n",
