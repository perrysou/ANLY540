      "“But we haven’t seen the Mate 20 Pro square off against the XS Max,” Potuck reports. “After Huawei previously claimed its Kirin 980 chipset would be faster than Apple’s A12 Bionic, the Mate 20 has suffered a defeat in the latest smartphone speed test.”\n",
      "“Back in September, Huawei came out and said that its in-house Kirin 980 chip would be speedier than Apple’s A12 Bionic,” Potuck reports. “Even with Huawei using a custom chip and double the RAM, this test shows that Apple’s tight integration between its hardware and software is second to none.”\n",
      " Take: “ Gone up against.” Sheesh.\n",
      "Anyway, unsurprisingly, Huawei’s dog-slow pretend iPhone, like all other pretend iPhones before it, loses.\n",
      "With each passing year, and especially with iPhone X, it becomes increasingly clear – even to the Android settlers – that the competition has no chance of even remotely keeping up against Apple’s unmatched vertically integrated one-two punch of custom software and custom hardware.

      "\n",
      "Advertisement Advertisement Apple’s W1 chip: What is it, and why don’t Android users get a bite? - December 11, 2018 If you're using AirPods or modern Beats headphones with the iOS 10 or later, you'll experience improved connectivity via the W1 chip.\n",
      "It's easy to harangue Apple for its gravitation toward proprietary hardware and near criminal prices — which we do — even we have to admit the Cupertino-based company's W1 chip promotes a seamless Bluetooth audio experience for iOS users. The W1 chip, in brief With iOS 11 to boot, Apple's iPad 5 is compatible with the company's proprietary chip.\n",
      "Apple's W1 chip is an Apple-exclusive system-in-package chip that optimizes audio streaming for listeners using AirPods , or more recent Beats headphones, and offers three main benefits: Users with compatible devices experience immediate device pairing and re-connecting. Bluetooth connectivity is stable and reliable. Per the SoundGuys review, the AirPods' connectivity seems immune to stuttering , a rare feat for true wireless earbuds . Devices with an integrated W1 chip are less power-hungry, meaning listeners can worry less about finding the nearest outlet and spend more time enjoying their music.\n",
      "For an Apple user to reap these perks, their phone must run on iOS 10 or later, and the headphones must also support AAC . The latter bit is crucial for lag-free playback and optimized audio quality. As an audio format, AAC supports 24-bit 96kHz audio quality, but the Bluetooth format constrains it to just below CD quality . Fortunately, it shouldn't be too difficult to meet these demands considering even the technologically archaic iPhone 5 is iOS 10-compatible, and plenty of earbuds support AAC . Still, wired listening is always superior where performance is concerned.\n",
      "Related: Are Beats headphones worth it? Where's Android's W1 chip? There are a wide array of Android manufacturers, making it near impossible to implement similar hardware to Apple's.\n",
      "Nowhere in sight. Editor's Pick What is 5G, and what can we expect from it? You've likely heard the term a lot recently, but what is 5G? Good question. Simply put, 5G networking is the next major evolution of mobile wireless technology. It will empower customers with even faster data connections, …\n",
      "The Android enterprise is vastly different than Apple's, which is clearly demonstrated by the varying Bluetooth codec performances experienced on Android devices. Since there exist multiple Android manufacturers — as compared to Apple's sole presence — the Android experience can be disorienting, especially considering its asynchronous software updates .\n",
      "Although Google , Samsung , and LG users benefit from optimal software , greater customization, and superior audio performance, the lack of centralization curtails the possibility of a universally compatible chip like the W1.\n",
      "Perhaps an Android equivalent to the W1 chip will never see the light of day, but Bluetooth improvements are inevitable.\n",
      "Now, one could argue Bluetooth 5.0 support is comparable. It's hardly a hill to die on, as there are palpable benefits to the updated firmware, but it's not the same as having a dedicated chipset. Plus, iPhones support Bluetooth 5, too, so the firmware doesn't have the same exclusive panache as the W1 chip.\n",
      "Admittedly, it's unlikely Android users will see a W1 chip equivalent any time soon — if ever — but that doesn't exclude the possibility of global Bluetooth streaming improvements, which I remain ever-optimistic about. #Google #Android #Smartphones #OS #News @ndrdnws #ndrdnws #AndroidNews Popular Posts: \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\" Whether you’re applying to law school, are a lawyer, or just have a great love for the show Suits, it might interest you to know that the LSAT is going digital next year and the chosen tablets are Microsoft’s Surface Go .\n",
      "The organization behind the LSAT, the Law School Admission Council (LSAC), says it went through hundreds of tablets to choose the winner. Some well known devices just didn’t have enough going for them. Apple’s iPads were too pricey and their proprietary ecosystem made it difficult to modify, while cheaper Chromebooks were not of high enough quality. “You just can’t have a test that is this important and end up with something that isn’t really reliable. If somebody takes the test, and the device fails on them, that’s additional stress coupled with the stress of test day,” says Troy Lowry, LSAC’s senior vice president of technology products and chief information officer. The move has curiously turned the LSAC into a group of Surface Go fans. Lowry says, “I get made fun of for it, but I love the kickstand that lets you put it in all different positions.” The move away from pen and paper test-taking (although some test takers in 2019 will still have the option) means that LSAT administrators have to be re-trained on how to give the exam, and there are other changes to infrastructure that are sure to cost money. Neither the LSAC nor Microsoft would disclose how much money went toward the transition. When asked whether going digital meant the $190 application fee for the LSAT would be lowered or perhaps increase due to the cost of the tablets, LSAC also didn’t have a definite answer. “We evaluate the fees annually, because we’re working to help candidates be able to apply and not be pushed out due to raised fees,” says Kellye Testy, the president and CEO of LSAC. “The cost is still in flux because we’re reevaluating the number of students applying to law school every year.” The LSAT is going digital exclusively on Microsoft Surface Go tablets - The Verge  \n",

      "So is this it — the end of the decade-long bull market?\n",
      "\n",
      "Or is it the sort of normal, healthy pullback that often follows a strong showing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Last week, it felt like the bottom dropped out of the stock market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average fell 4.5 percent for the week, ending with a 559-point rout Friday that left the index in negative territory for the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has fallen into a \"correction,\" meaning it's off more than 10 percent from its peak reached Sept. 20.\n",
      "\n",
      "And once-highflying tech stocks faltered with Apple, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet all ending last week showing stock-price losses for the year — driving the Nasdaq composite index into a correction too.\n",
      "\n",
      "So is this it — the end of the decade-long bull market?\n",
      "\n",
      "Or is it the sort of normal, healthy pullback that often follows a strong showing?\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Everyone is trying to figure that out,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, though he's among those arguing that stocks are going through a typical retreat after lengthy gains, as they often have.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obscuring any clarity for both professional money managers and millions of Americans with 401(k)s and other retirement accounts are conflicting trends that are keeping downward pressure on stock prices and sparking volatile trading.\n",
      "\n",
      "They include the U.S.-China tariffs and trade battle, falling oil prices, the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, President Donald Trump's mercurial bursts on Twitter, declining growth in corporate profits — and, ultimately, fears that the nine-year economic expansion is ready for a cyclical contraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "This fall's pullback is nowhere near as severe — at least not yet — as some of the major busts of the past two decades.\n",
      "\n",
      "The S&P 500 fell nearly 57 percent during the 2008-09 financial crisis and nearly 49 percent in the dot-com crash of 2000-02.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those were bear markets, or drops of 20 percent or more from their previous highs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the triple-digit swings in the Dow industrial average — while unnerving a decade ago — are now more common because the market has climbed so high since then, and the declines are less severe on a percentage basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, when the Dow fell 508 points on Oct. 19, 1987, it was a 22.6 percent loss — the largest single-day percentage drop on record.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the stock market reached its highest levels in history only a few months ago, and that was after the market soared in 2017, when the S&P 500 gained nearly 20 percent and the Nasdaq composite rose 28 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "As a result, it's not surprising that investors would be willing to sell and capture those profits when signs of trouble surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year also was unusual for the dearth of volatility that is now again common.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We had an incredible amount of investor optimism coming out of the election in 2016,\" said Peter Heilbron, senior investment officer of Northern Trust Wealth Management.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Last year was the anomaly, not this year.\n",
      "\n",
      "A year like this is much more normal for the market than we had in 2017.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "That's not to discount the pain investors have felt in recent months or how dangerous the trade and economic threats are to the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "The S&P 500 lost 6.9 percent in October, its biggest monthly decline in seven years.\n",
      "\n",
      "And last week the yield on 5-year Treasury bonds fell below the yield for 2-year bonds for the first time since 2007 — a so-called inverted yield curve that is typically seen as a gauge of recession risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Investors typically are rewarded with higher yields for locking up their money longer, not the other way around.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet stocks also are on pace to end the year with minor changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even after last week's dreary showing, the Dow and S&P 500 were down only 1.3 percent and 1.5 percent for the year, respectively, and the Nasdaq was up 1 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors also pay attention to how stock prices compare with the underlying corporate earnings for those stocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "If prices get too far ahead of the earnings growth, the stocks might be too \"rich\" or pricey and vulnerable to a sell-off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, if prices match or lag behind earnings growth, it might be a buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early this year, the S&P 500 was trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 18.7 times the expected average earnings of the S&P component companies for the next 12 months, according to FactSet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, with the market having tumbled, that forward price-to-earnings multiple has fallen to 15.44, which is about average.\n",
      "\n",
      "The consensus seems to be that corporate earnings are slowing — albeit from a blistering pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stovall said that at the start of this year Wall Street expected earnings growth of 11.5 percent for 2018.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It looks like we're going to see twice that amount, with average earnings (growth) for the S&P (companies) of 23 percent,\" — profits, he said, that were partly fueled by the drop in federal corporate tax rates from the Republican tax cuts.\n",
      "\n",
      "But next year he projects that growth will slow to 7.5 percent.\n",
